            <h3>Written Questions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The horizontal barplot shows a clear representation of the top video game sales of all time, and the
                    top 10 per year should the user wish to enter a specific year.<br>
                    The pie chart shows the top 5 best selling genres per region, representing each genre as a
                    proportional part of the whole.<br>
                    The vertical barplot shows the top publishers for a genre by total sale count, and allows the user
                    to select how many publishers to visualize, and which genre to visualize.<br>
                    All three of these graphs are appropriate for the content they are displaying, and allow the user to
                    quickly and easily get the info they want at a glance.

                    Three reasons D3 was helpful:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            D3 allowed for very easy dynamic charts simply by calling the same chart function again with
                            slightly different data.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            D3's built in transitions/animations allowed for fluid and responsive visualizations that
                            greatly help UX.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            D3's tracking and features allowed for easy tooltips, dynamically generated based on the
                            data the user is hovering over.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Three reasons D3 would not be the best tool for creating a visualization:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            D3 runs in Javascript, which requires the use of a browser. This is a non-trivial amount of
                            processing/resources for a system, and there are many situations in which running a full
                            browser engine is not feasible. For example, giving a presentation on a screen powered by an
                            embedded machine that does not have a browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            D3 would not be a good choice to display simple, static data, as it requires a non-trivial
                            amount of overhead (in resources, developer time, and network bandwidth) simply to set up.
                            If a user wishes to simply display some basic static data, it makes more sense to generate a
                            graph quickly in Excel or similar, and share that around. Using D3 for such a task would be
                            a waste of developer time and computing power, where a simply .jpg export of an Excel graph
                            would suffice.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For advanced visualizations with extreme amounts of data, D3 would not be a good choice. D3
                            requires the client to load the data browser-side and do computations before finally
                            rendering in the browser. This is not a feasible solution if the data were of medium to
                            large size &mdash; most machines could not possibly load a few GBs (or TBs) of data into
                            memory to process and render in the browser. For this use case, it makes much more sense to
                            have the data in a dedicated database, and use a native application to process and display
                            the data to the client.
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    I think my dashboard is relatively accessible, according to the second article.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Follow color contrast guidelines:</strong> My background colors and text have enough
                            contrast when they are overlapping. I could have however, improved the color contrast
                            between by bars/slices themselves. However, the lack of contrast is alleviated somewhat by
                            the wide separation between the elements, as described in the third point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Label data points directly:</strong> I did this as well &mdash; all axes are labeled
                            directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Separate elements with whitespace or pattern:</strong> All my bars and pie chart
                            slices have white space separating them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Avoid complex tooling:</strong> All my interactions are done in the form of explicit
                            buttons and direct text input rather than sliders and other intricate tools.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Avoid hover overlays:</strong> I labeled data directly as opposed to hover overlays,
                            except in the third graph where I used a tooltip hover overlay in order to meet the criteria
                            for this project.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When I designed the color scheme, I was going much more for a soft, visually-appealing pattern
                    that's easy on the eyes instead of a high-contrast color scheme. This was purely for aesthetic
                    purposes, so I could have gone with a higher-contrast gradient for the graphs instead.<br>
                    In addition, I initially had data labelled directly on the third graph, however the requirements of
                    the project required a tooltip, and I felt the data was redundant to have both on a hover tooltip
                    and directly on the graph, so I removed the data that was directly placed on the graph.
